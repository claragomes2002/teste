    <h1>Yoko Ono e o biscoito do George</h1>

    <p>One member of the studio personnel closely involved with the LP [Abbey Road], 
        who prefers to remain anonymous, recalls a very bitter row between John Lennon and 
        George Harrison during the time that Yoko was attending sessions in her double-bed. 
        ‘She got up and took a digestive biscuit off the top of George’s Leslie speaker cabinet. 
        George saw this from the control room window and got into a big argument with John. 
        The biscuit thing was soon forgotten; it seemed to me that they just wanted an excuse to 
        argue, to air their pent-up resentments.</p>
